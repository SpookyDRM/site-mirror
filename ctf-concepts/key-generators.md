## Serial Fishing

Serial fishing is the process of extracting a valid serial from a binary without writing a key generator. For example, consider a crackme that requires a username and a serial. The program transforms the username and uses that transformation as the serial. During debugging, we can locate the function responsible for generating the valid serial, extract the serial from memory, and use it the next time we are prompted for a serial.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    std::cout << "This is a placeholder" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
