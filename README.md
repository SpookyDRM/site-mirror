# SpookyDRM

SpookyDRM is a website made to host my notes and other research about reverse engineering and malware analysis. Here, I document my journey through the complexities of software reverse engineering and malware behavior, creating a resource that not only helps me organize my thoughts but also serves as a reference for others interested in these topics.

> Knowledge should be free and easily accessible to everyone.
